# UFO Finder
A project to create a website that can be used for filtering UFO sighting data.
## Challenge Overview
To utilize JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a website that allows a user to input filtering criteria for analyzing data on UFO sightings.
## Results
This website contains a list of UFO sightings throughout the country. Through the use of JavaScript I was able to construct functions that 
enable the user to narrow their search for analyzing UFO sightings. Below is a snapshot reflecting the code behind the Filter Search feature within the website.

From the user's perspective, below is the search section of the website. The data can be filtered in five separate ways. Additionally, they can be used in conjunction with 
eachother in order to slice the data even further.

## Summary
In summary, this functionality can be very useful for UFO researchers. One drawback which must be considered is the current dataset. It is limited to events from 1/1/2010 through
1/13/2010. Therefore, expanding the dataset should be a priority. This will require updating the data.js file that exists. One other suggested action, which piggybacks onto the update of the dataset, would be to incorporate a section which allows the user to input new data themselves. This would allow the website to become vastly more useful to UFO researchers interested in a topic which is always evolving.
